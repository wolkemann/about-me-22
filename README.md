   ### Gentle Letters 
   Gentle Letters is an anonymous and relaxing social App where you can send letters and wait a response from a random stranger who is willig to help you. As a token of appreciation for your Helper's precious words (hopefully!), you can can send a sticker to let the Helper know you read the response and appreciated it.

   ### Geschichte Engine
   The Geschichte Engine is a library written to create dynamic and animated Visual Novels. At the moment the project is getting a complete overhaul to improve to code and make it more readble and developer-friendly. You can still, however, play the demo.
