   ### Gentle Letters 
   Gentle Letters is an anonymous and relaxing social App where you can send letters and wait a response from a random stranger who is willig to help you. As a token of appreciation for your Helper's precious words (hopefully!), you can can send a sticker to let the Helper know you read the response and appreciated it.
